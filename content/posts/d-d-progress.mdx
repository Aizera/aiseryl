My D&D party (Warlock and Dwarf) met a mystery character in the dungeon that grins with with too plenty of a teeth. His right arm is a claw, his left arm is a human arm and a claw which forks at the elbow, and then his right leg is a mixture of claw and tentacle which forks at the knee.  It seems like he's immune to physical damage, and his wounds are constantly healing. He is not fighting back, which somewhat worries the party. We're not sure if he could just transfer all the damage we deal and sending it flying back to us.

It may seem to have been human at one point.
